# P2P_Mesh_Communication_Learning_Kit_SKEE1103_C_Programming_for_Engineers

For this project, our main targeted users were particularly the high school students who are able to comprehend most basic peer-to-peer mesh communication knowledge which often included in STEM subject syllabus such as Computer Science and Physics subject. 

Other than that, students are also exposed to an exciting involvement in Arduino kit development, lies under the usage of microcontrollers, which is a foundational skillset for their Reka Bentuk Teknologi subject that includes hardware and software implementations.

In short, we want student to head the ground up, build up a Peer-to-Peer Mesh Communication Device on their own with given instructions manual, enhance their practical skills on utilise a microcontroller and strengthen their understanding towards wireless communication protocols.
